# Context Provider

🧝‍♂️ I was refactoring things a bit and decided we shouldn't need to pass
the `query` and `setSearchParams` as props. Instead I just wanted to call
`useSearchParams` in each of the components that need them (there's only one
URL afterall).

Well that didn't work. Turns out we now have multiple instances of the search
params state and multiple subscriptions to the `popstate` event. That's not
what we want at all. It's busted right now. Can you fix this with context?

👨‍💼 No worries Kellie. We can fix this.

So we want to create a context provider that will provide the `useSearchParams`
hook to the rest of the app.

We're going to take this in steps though. First we'll create the context
provider, render it around the app, and then make a new `useSearchParams` hook
that will use the context value.

Good luck! When you're finished, the app should be working again!
