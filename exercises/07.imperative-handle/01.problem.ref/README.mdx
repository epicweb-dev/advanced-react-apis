# useImperativeHandle

👨‍💼 We've got a new thing for you to work on. Kellie 🧝‍♂️ put together a
`Scrollable` component which is a wrapper around a `div` that has a way to
scroll to the top and bottom of the content. We want to be able to add buttons
to the `App` that will allow users to scroll to the top and bottom of the
content when clicked.

So we need you to `useImperativeHandle` to expose a `scrollToTop` and
`scrollToBottom` method from the `Scrollable` component. These methods are
already implemented, you just need to expose them.
