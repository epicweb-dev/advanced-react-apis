# Optimize state updates

👨‍💼 We're bringing back our search and card page. Now we are storing the entire
`URLSearchParams` in state (not just the `query` param) and we want to make sure
we don't rerender the page if the params are unchanged.

If you want to test this out, you'll notice we have added a `console.log` in the
function body for the `App` component so you can know each time the component
rerenders, and also put one in the `setSearchParams` callback so you know
each time we call `setSearchParams`. Submit the form multiple times observe the
logs. Alternate between changing the search params and not changing them.

When you're all finished, it should log whenever you set the search params, but
it should not log the rerender when you submit the form without changing the
query.
