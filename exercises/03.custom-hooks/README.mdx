That's it. That's the entire idea behind custom hooks. So...

```tsx
function useCount() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1)
	return { count, increment }
}

function Counter() {
	const { count, increment } = useCount()
	return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}
```

The `useCount` function is a custom hook. The `use` prefix is a convention to
indicate that this function is a hook and has to follow all of the
[rules of hooks](https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning)

Custom hooks are fantastic because they allow you to encapsulate complex logic
and share that logic between components.

However, all abstraction has a cost, and that's true of custom hooks as well.
In particular, if you have a utility function you want to share and people call
that function within a `useEffect` or other hook which has a dependency array
you suddenly need to start worrying about identity and referential equality.

For example, consider our `increment` function from the `useCount` hook. Let's
pretend we're going to use it in a `useEffect`:

```tsx
function Counter() {
	const { count, increment } = useCount()
	React.useEffect(() => {
		// set up a timer to increment the count every second or something...
		const id = setInterval(() => {
			increment()
		}, 1000)
		return () => clearInterval(id)
	}, [increment]) // <-- we need to include increment in the dependency list
	return <div>{count}</div>
}
```

The problem with this is that `increment` is a new function every render as we
currently have it defined. So every re-render of `Counter` will cause the
`useEffect` cleanup to be run clearing the interval and setting up a new one.
This is not what we want. So we have to make sure that the `increment` function
never changes. We can do that with the `useCallback` hook.

Before we get into `useCallback`, let's talk about memoization in general.

### Memoization in general

Memoization: a performance optimization technique which eliminates the need to
recompute a value for a given input by storing the original computation and
returning that stored value when the same input is provided. Memoization is a
form of caching. Here's a simple implementation of memoization:

```typescript
const values = {}
function addOne(num: number) {
	if (values[num] === undefined) {
		values[num] = num + 1 // <-- here's the computation
	}
	return values[num]
}
```

One other aspect of memoization is value referential equality. For example:

```typescript
const dog1 = new Dog('sam')
const dog2 = new Dog('sam')
console.log(dog1 === dog2) // false
```

Even though those two dogs have the same name, they are not the same. However,
we can use memoization to get the same dog:

```typescript
const dogs = {}
function getDog(name: string) {
	if (dogs[name] === undefined) {
		dogs[name] = new Dog(name)
	}
	return dogs[name]
}

const dog1 = getDog('sam')
const dog2 = getDog('sam')
console.log(dog1 === dog2) // true
```

You might have noticed that our memoization examples look very similar.
Memoization is something you can implement as a generic abstraction:

```typescript
function memoize<ArgType, ReturnValue>(cb: (arg: ArgType) => ReturnValue) {
	const cache: Record<ArgType, ReturnValue> = {}
	return function memoized(arg: ArgType) {
		if (cache[arg] === undefined) {
			cache[arg] = cb(arg)
		}
		return cache[arg]
	}
}

const addOne = memoize((num: number) => num + 1)
const getDog = memoize((name: string) => new Dog(name))
```

Our abstraction only supports one argument, if you want to make it work for any
type/number of arguments, knock yourself out.

### Memoization in React

Luckily, in React we don't have to implement a memoization abstraction. They
made two for us! `useMemo` and `useCallback`. For more on this read:
[Memoization and React](https://epicreact.dev/memoization-and-react).

So, going back to our earlier example, here's how you solve the problem:

```tsx lines=3
function useCount() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	const increment = useCallback(() => setCount((c) => c + 1), [])
	return { count, increment }
}

function Counter() {
	const { count, increment } = useCount()
	useEffect(() => {
		const id = setInterval(increment, 1000)
		return () => clearInterval(id)
	}, [increment])
	return <div>{count}</div>
}
```

What that does is we pass React a function and React gives that same function
back to us... Sounds kinda useless right? Imagine:

```tsx
// this is not how React actually implements this function. We're just imagining!
function useCallback(callback) {
	return callback
}
```

Uhhh... But there's a catch! On subsequent renders, if the elements in the
dependency list are unchanged, instead of giving the same function back that we
give to it, React will give us the same function it gave us last time. So
imagine:

```tsx
// this is not how React actually implements this function. We're just imagining!
let lastCallback
function useCallback(callback, deps) {
	if (depsChanged(deps)) {
		lastCallback = callback
		return callback
	} else {
		return lastCallback
	}
}
```

So while we still create a new function every render (to pass to `useCallback`),
React only gives us the new one if the dependency list changes.

In this exercise, we're going to be using `useCallback`, but `useCallback` is
just a shortcut to using `useMemo` for functions:

```typescript
// the useMemo version:
const increment = useMemo(() => () => setCount((c) => c + 1), [])

// the useCallback version
const increment = useCallback(() => setCount((c) => c + 1), [])
```

One other thing to note is that `useCallback` and `useMemo` also have dependency
array and it functions the same way as the dependency array in `useEffect`. If
you don't include all the dependencies, you'll have bugs. And if the things you
include in the dependency array are not stable, then it'll undo the stability
of the memoization as well. This is how dependency arrays can spider out into
everything you do which is one reason why it's handy to avoid abstracting early.

There's a strategy to help you avoid dependency arrays talked about in
[Myths about `useEffect`](https://epicreact.dev/myths-about-useeffect).
Additionally, there's a pattern you can use to help reduce the issue (with its
own set of trade-offs) which we'll explore in the React Patterns workshop.

ðŸ¦‰ Better understand memoization by diving deep on caching with my talk [Caching for Cash](https://www.epicweb.dev/talks/caching-for-cash).

ðŸ¦‰ A common question with this is: "Why don't we just wrap every function in
`useCallback`?" You can read about this in my blog post
[When to useMemo and useCallback](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback).

ðŸ¦‰ And if the concept of a "closure" is new or confusing to you, then
[give this a read](https://mdn.io/closure). (Closures are one of the reasons
it's important to keep dependency lists correct.)
