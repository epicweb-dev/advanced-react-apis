# Layout Computation

Sometimes you need to compute the layout of some UI before it is actually
displayed. This is often necessary if the size, position, or location of your UI
depends on the size, position, or location of the other elements on the page or
even itself (like the contents of a tooltip).

The trouble is, sometimes you don't know the size, position, or location of the
other elements on the page until the layout has been computed. So what happens
is you render the UI, then you make your measurements, then you re-render the UI
with the new measurements. This is inefficient and can cause flickering.

To avoid this problem in React, you can use the `useLayoutEffect` hook. This
hook is designed with this specific use case in mind and is not a hook you'll
find yourself needing very often.

It literally has the same API as `useEffect`, but it runs synchronously after
the DOM has been updated. You may recall from the `useEffect` exercise, the
[React flow diagram](https://github.com/donavon/hook-flow):

The `useLayoutEffect` hook runs after the DOM has been updated but before the
browser has had a chance to paint the screen. This means you can make your
measurements and then render the UI with the correct measurements before the
user sees anything.
