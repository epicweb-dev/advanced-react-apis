# useLayoutEffect

👨‍💼 Our tooltip is great, but we do need to make measurements when we display it.
We do this in a `useEffect` hook now with code like this:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
	const rect = ref.current?.getBoundingClientRect()
	if (!rect) return
	const { height } = rect
	setTooltipHeight(height)
}, [])
```

That `height` is used to determine whether the tooltip should appear above or
below the target element (the heart in our case).

Kellie 🧝‍♂️ noticed on low-end devices, they're seeing a little flicker
so <DiffLink app1={-1}>she's added</DiffLink> an arbitrary slowdown to our
component to simulate that problem. To reproduce the problem, simply hover over
a heart and you'll notice it starts at the bottom of the heart and then flickers
to the top (if there's room on the top of the heart).

So your job is simple. Change `useEffect` to `useLayoutEffect` and that should
fix things.
