# Advanced React Hooks 🔥

👨‍💼 Congratulations! You've finished the workshop!

🦉 There are a few hooks that we haven't covered in this workshop that we won't
be covering in Epic Web because they're extremely rarely used in the wild. Feel
free to read up on them here:

- [`useDebugValue`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDebugValue)
- [`useInsertionEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useInsertionEffect)
