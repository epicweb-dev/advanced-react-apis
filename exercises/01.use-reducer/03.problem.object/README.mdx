# State Object

👨‍💼 Back in the day, we had `this.setState` from class components? We're going to
make the state updater (`dispatch` function) behave in a similar way by changing
our `state` to an object (`{count: 0}`) and then calling the state updater with
an object which merges with the current state.

So here's how I want things to look now:

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useReducer(countReducer, {
	count: initialCount,
})
const { count } = state
const increment = () => setState({ count: count + step })
const decrement = () => setState({ count: count - step })
```

How would you need to change the reducer to make this work?

How would you make it support multiple state properties? For example:

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useReducer(countReducer, {
	count: initialCount,
	someOtherState: 'hello',
})
const { count } = state
const increment = () => setState({ count: count + step })
const decrement = () => setState({ count: count - step })
```

Calling `increment` or `decrement` in this case should only update the `count`
property and leave the `someOtherState` property alone. So the `setState`
function should merge the new state with the old state.
