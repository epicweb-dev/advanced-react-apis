# Traditional Reducer

👨‍💼 Now it's time to get to the actual convention for reducers in React apps.

Update your reducer so I can do this:

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(countReducer, {
	count: initialCount,
})
const { count } = state
const increment = () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT', step })
const decrement = () => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT', step })
```

The key here is that the logic for updating the state is now in the reducer, and
the component is just dispatching actions. This actually gives us a bit of a
declarative API for updating state, which is nice. The component is just saying
what it wants to happen, and the reducer is the one that decides how to make it
happen.
