# createPortal

👨‍💼 Some of our users find the heart icon to be unclear and would like to have a
tooltip that explains what it's for.

🧝‍♂️ I've moved things around a little bit to reduce the amount of code you need
to work in. I've also added a simple tooltip component that's not working quite
yet. The positioning is all funny because the tooltip is being rendered within
the context of the card instead of at the root of the document.

👨‍💼 Thanks Kellie. Now, let's see if you can make the tooltip component work
properly with a portal.

Note, the change you're making is pretty minimal. You'll also need to change
some of the CSS to make the tooltip look a little better.

🦉 Don't forget about the "Files" button in the bottom of this screen. It will
show you which files are changed in this exercise step and allow you to click
to open the relevant files.

	Typically you'll want to use a library for tooltips which have been tested for
	accessibility best practices. But they're likely using `createPortal` under
	the hood and you'll very likely find yourself needing to use this API at some
	point.
