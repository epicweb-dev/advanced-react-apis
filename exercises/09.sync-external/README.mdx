# Sync External State

Not everything we build on the web is built with React. There are libraries and
platform APIs that are external to React. Bringing those things into React's
component model and state management lifecycle is necessary for building
full-featured applications.

The task is to synchronize the external world with the internal state of a
React component. To do this, we use the `useSyncExternalStore` hook.

Let's take the example of a component that displays your current location via
the geolocation API. The geolocation API is not a part of React, so we need to
synchronize the external state of the geolocation API with the internal state of
our component.

```tsx lines=25-28
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react'

type LocationData =
	| { status: 'unavailable'; geo?: never }
	| { status: 'available'; geo: GeolocationPosition }
// this variable is our external store!
let location: LocationData = { status: 'unavailable' }

function subscribeToGeolocation(callback: () => void) {
	const watchId = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition((position) => {
		location = { status: 'available', geo: position }
		callback()
	})
	return () => {
		location = { status: 'unavailable' }
		return navigator.geolocation.clearWatch(watchId)
	}
}

function getGeolocationSnapshot() {
	return location
}

function MyLocation() {
	const location = useSyncExternalStore(
		subscribeToGeolocation,
		getGeolocationSnapshot,
	)
	return (
		<div>
			{location.status === 'unavailable' ? (
				'Your location is unavailable'
			) : (
				<>
					Your location is {location.geo.coords.latitude.toFixed(2)}
					{'°, '}
					{location.geo.coords.longitude.toFixed(2)}
					{'°'}
				</>
			)}
		</div>
	)
}
```

Here's the basic API:

```tsx
const snapshot = useSyncExternalStore(
	subscribe,
	getSnapshot,
	getServerSnapshot, // optional
)
```

- `subscribe` is a function that takes a callback and returns a cleanup function.
  The callback is called whenever the external store changes to let React know
  it should call `getSnapshot` to get the new value.
- `getSnapshot` is a function that returns the current value of the external
  store.
- `getServerSnapshot` is an optional function that returns the current value of
  the external store from the server. This is useful for server-side rendering
  and rehydration. If you don't provide this function, then React will render
  the nearest `Suspense` boundary `fallback` on the server and then when the
  client hydrates, it will call `getSnapshot` to get the current value.

The `Suspense` Component is something we'll get to in a future workshop. For
now, think of it as a way to declaratively handle loading states in React
(because that's what it is and that's all you need to know for now).
