# Handling Server Rendering

👨‍💼 Great work! You now know how to properly handle server rendering of something
we don't know until the client-render when it comes to an external store like
this.

🦉 There are more things you can do for different cases (like the user's
light/dark mode preference) to offer a better user experience. Check out

to see how you can handle this even better if you're interested.
