# useContext: Caching response data in context

## Exercise

Let's try the last exercise over again with a bit more of a complex/practical
example. That's right! We're back to the Pokemon info app! This time it has
caching in place which is cool. So if you enter the same pokemon information,
it's cached so it loads instantaneously.

However, we have a requirement that we want to list all the cached pokemon in
another part of the app, so we're going to use context to store the cache. This
way both parts of the app which need access to the pokemon cache will have
access.
