# useReducer: simple Counter

## Background

React's `useState` hook can get you a really long way with React state
management. That said, sometimes you want to separate the state logic from the
components that make the state changes. In addition, if you have multiple
elements of state that typically change together, then having an object that
contains those elements of state can be quite helpful.

This is where `useReducer` comes in really handy. If you're familiar with redux,
then you'll feel pretty comfortable here. If not, then you have less to unlearn
ðŸ˜‰

This exercise will take you pretty deep into `useReducer`. Typically, you'll use
`useReducer` with an object of state, but we're going to start by managing a
single number (a `count`). We're doing this to ease you into `useReducer` and
help you learn the difference between the convention and the actual API.

Here's an example of using `useReducer` to manage the value of a name in an
input.

```javascript
function nameReducer(previousName, action) {
  return action
}

const initialNameValue = 'Joe'

function NameInput() {
  const [name, setName] = React.useReducer(nameReducer, initialNameValue)
  const handleChange = event => setName(event.target.value)
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name: <input defaultValue={name} onChange={handleChange} />
      </label>
      <div>You typed: {name}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

One important thing to note here is that the reducer (called `nameReducer`
above) is called with two arguments:

1. the current state
2. whatever it is that the dispatch function (called `setName` above) is called
   with

## Exercise

For now, just focus on making things work with `React.useReducer`. In the next
exercise you'll get to see how this can be a real improvement over
`React.useState` :)

## Extra Credit

### ðŸ’¯ accept the step as the action

I want to change things a bit to have this API:

```javascript
const [count, changeCount] = React.useReducer(countReducer, initialCount)
const increment = () => changeCount(step)
```

How would you need to change your reducer to make this work?

This one is just to show that you can pass anything as the action.

### ðŸ’¯ simulate setState with an object

Remember `this.setState` from class components? Let's see if you can figure out
how to make the state updater (`dispatch` function) behave in a similar way by
changing our `state` to an object (`{count: 0}`) and then calling the state
updater with an object which merges with the current state.

So here's how I want things to look now:

```javascript
const [state, setState] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {
  count: initialCount,
})
const {count} = state
const increment = () => setState({count: count + 1})
```

How would you need to change the reducer to make this work?

### ðŸ’¯ simulate setState with an object OR function

`this.setState` can also accepts a function. See if you can figure out how to
make your reducer support both:

```javascript
const [state, setState] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {
  count: initialCount,
})
const {count} = state
const increment = () =>
  setState(currentState => ({count: currentState.count + 1}))
```

### ðŸ’¯ traditional dispatch object with a type and switch statement

Ok, now we can finally see what people do conventionally (mostly thanks to
redux). Update your reducer so I can do this:

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {
  count: initialCount,
})
const {count} = state
const increment = () => dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'})
```

## ðŸ¦‰ Other Notes

### The full `useReducer` API

If you're into TypeScript, here's some type definitions for `useReducer`:

> Please don't spend too much time reading through this by the way!

```typescript
type Dispatch<A> = (value: A) => void
type Reducer<S, A> = (prevState: S, action: A) => S
type ReducerState<R extends Reducer<any, any>> = R extends Reducer<infer S, any>
  ? S
  : never
type ReducerAction<R extends Reducer<any, any>> = R extends Reducer<
  any,
  infer A
>
  ? A
  : never

function useReducer<R extends Reducer<any, any>, I>(
  reducer: R,
  initializerArg: I & ReducerState<R>,
  initializer: (arg: I & ReducerState<R>) => ReducerState<R>,
): [ReducerState<R>, Dispatch<ReducerAction<R>>]

function useReducer<R extends Reducer<any, any>, I>(
  reducer: R,
  initializerArg: I,
  initializer: (arg: I) => ReducerState<R>,
): [ReducerState<R>, Dispatch<ReducerAction<R>>]

function useReducer<R extends Reducer<any, any>>(
  reducer: R,
  initialState: ReducerState<R>,
  initializer?: undefined,
): [ReducerState<R>, Dispatch<ReducerAction<R>>]
```

`useReducer` is pretty versatile. They key takeaway here is that while
conventions are useful, understanding the API and its capabilities is more
important.
