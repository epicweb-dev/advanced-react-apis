# useCallback: custom hooks

## Background

You know the dependency list of `useEffect`? Here's a quick refresher:

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  window.localStorage.setItem('count', count)
}, [count]) // <-- that's the dependency list
```

Remember that the dependency list is how React knows whether to call your
callback (and if you don't provide one then React will call your callback every
render). It does this to ensure that the side effect you're performing in the
callback doesn't get out of sync with the state of the application.

But what happens if I use a function in my callback?

```javascript
const updateLocalStorage = () => window.localStorage.setItem('count', count)
React.useEffect(() => {
  updateLocalStorage()
}, []) // <-- what goes in that dependency list?
```

We could just put the `count` in the dependency list and that would actually
work, but what would happen if we changed `updateLocalStorage`?

```javascript
const updateLocalStorage = () => window.localStorage.setItem(key, count)
```

Would we remember to update the dependency list to include the `key`? Hopefully
we would. But this can be a pain to keep track of dependencies. Especially if
the function that we're using in our `useEffect` callback is coming to us from
props (in the case of a custom component) or arguments (in the case of a custom
hook).

Instead, it would be much easier if we could just put the function itself in the
dependency list:

```javascript
const updateLocalStorage = () => window.localStorage.setItem('count', count)
React.useEffect(() => {
  updateLocalStorage()
}, [updateLocalStorage]) // <-- function as a dependency
```

The problem with that though is because `updateLocalStorage` is defined inside
the component function body, it's re-initialized every render, which means it's
brand new every render, which means it changes every render, which means, you
guessed it, our callback will be called every render!

**This is the problem `useCallback` solves**. And here's how you solve it

```javascript
const updateLocalStorage = React.useCallback(
  () => window.localStorage.setItem('count', count),
  [count], // <-- yup! That's a dependency list!
)
React.useEffect(() => {
  updateLocalStorage()
}, [updateLocalStorage])
```

What that does is we pass React a function and React gives that same function
back to us, but with a catch. On subsequent renders, if the elements in the
dependency list are unchanged, instead of giving the same function back that we
give to it, React will give us the same function it gave us last time.

So while we still create a new function every render (to pass to `useCallback`),
React only gives us the new one if the dependency list changes.

🦉 A common question with this is: "Why don't we just wrap every function in
`useCallback`?" You can read about this in my blog post
[When to useMemo and useCallback](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback).

## Exercise

For the exercise, we have a reducer that's responsible for managing the state of
the promise for fetching the pokemon. Managing async state is something every
app does all the time so it would be nice if we could abstract that away into a
custom hook and make use of it elsewhere.

Your job is to extract the logic from the `PokemonInfo` component into a custom
`useAsync` hook. In the process you'll find you need to do some fancy things
with dependencies.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 use useCallback to empower the user to customize memoization

Unfortunately, the ESLint plugin is unable to determine whether the
`dependencies` argument is a valid argument for `useEffect` which is a shame,
and normally I'd say just ignore it and move on. But, there's another solution
to this problem which I think is probably better.

Instead, of accepting `dependencies` to `useAsync`, why don't we just treat the
`asyncCallback` as a dependency? Any time `asyncCallback` changes, we know that
we should call it again. The problem is that because our `asyncCallback` depends
on the `pokemonName` which comes from props, it has to be defined within the
body of the component, which means that it will be defined on every render which
means it will be new every render. This is where `React.useCallback` comes in!

Here's a quick intro to the `React.useCallback` API:

```javascript
function ConsoleGreeting(props) {
  const greet = React.useCallback(
    greeting => console.log(`${greeting} ${props.name}`),
    [props.name],
  )

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const helloGreeting = 'Hello'
    greet(helloGreeting)
  }, [greet])
  return <div>check the console</div>
}
```

The first argument to `useCallback` is the callback you want called, the second
argument is an array of dependencies which is similar to `useEffect`. When one
of the dependencies changes between renders, the callback you passed in the
first argument will be the one returned from `useCallback`. If they do not
change, then you'll get the callback which was returned the previous time (so
the callback remains the same between renders).

So we only want our `asyncCallback` to change when the `pokemonName` changes.
See if you can make things work like this:

```javascript
// 🐨 you'll need to define asyncCallback as a value returned from React.useCallback
const state = useAsync(asyncCallback, {
  status: pokemonName ? 'pending' : 'idle',
})
```

### 2. 💯 return a memoized `run` function from useAsync

Requiring users to provide a memoized value is fine. You can document it as part
of the API and expect people to just read the docs right? lol, that's hilarious
😂 It'd be WAY better if we could redesign the API a bit so we (as the hook
developers) are the ones who have to memoize the function, and the users of our
hook don't have to worry about it.

So see if you can redesign this a little bit by providing a (memoized) `run`
function that people can call in their own `useEffect` like this:

```javascript
const {data: pokemon, status, error, run} = useAsync({
  status: pokemonName ? 'pending' : 'idle',
})

React.useEffect(() => {
  if (!pokemonName) {
    return
  }
  run(fetchPokemon(pokemonName))
}, [pokemonName, run])
```

### 3. 💯 make safeDispatch with useCallback, useRef, and useEffect

This one's a bit tricky, and I'm going to be intentionally vague here to give
you a bit of a challenge, but consider the scenario where we fetch a pokemon,
and before the request finishes, we change our mind and navigate to a different
page. In that case, the component would get removed from the page ("unmounted")
and when the request finally does complete, it will call `dispatch`, but because
the component has been removed from the page, we'll get this warning from React:

<pre style={{whiteSpace: 'normal'}}>Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.</pre>

The best solution to this problem would be to
[cancel the request](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/abortable-fetch),
but even then, we'd have to handle the error and prevent the `dispatch` from
being called for the rejected promise.

So see whether you can work out a solution for preventing `dispatch` from being
called if the component is unmounted. Depending on how you implement this, you
might need `useRef`, `useCallback`, and `useEffect`.
