# useReducer: HTTP requests

## Exercise

Let's get some more practice with `useReducer` in a more practical situation.
We've got a public graphql API at https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/. Don't worry,
you don't have to know graphql to do this exercise because I've made a simple
`fetchPokemon` function for you. All you have to do is pass it a pokemon's name
and you'll get a promise which resolves to the pokemon data.

In this exercise, we'll really see the benefits of `useReducer` shine through.
You're going to take an existing component that uses `useState` and works fine,
and you're going to improve it by switching it to `useReducer`.

## 💯 Extra Credit

### 💯 generic useAsync custom hook

This is where things get kinda exciting. There's already a great package for
managing async behavior in a generic way with a nice API. It's called
[react-async](https://react-async.dev) and it's great. We're going to build a
simple version of that out of what we've created so far. So for this extra
credit, I want you to create a custom `useAsync` hook which can be used like so:

```javascript
const state = useAsync(() => {
  if (!pokemonName) {
    return Promise.resolve(null)
  }
  return fetchPokemon(pokemonName)
}, [pokemonName])
const {data: pokemon, loading, error} = state
```

To be clear, the `useAsync` function signature would look like this:

```javascript
function useAsync(asyncCallback, dependencies) {
  // do hooks magic 🎩✨🐇
}
```

Where `dependencies` would be passed to the second argument of `useEffect`.

> Note: You may get an unavoidable ESLint warning about this. That's what the
> next extra credit is for.

### 💯 using useCallback to empower the user to customize memoization

Unfortunately, the ESLint plugin is unable to determine whether the
`dependencies` argument is a valid argument for `useEffect` which is a shame,
and normally I'd say just ignore it and move on. But, there's another solution
to this problem which I think is probably better.

Instead, of accepting `dependencies` to `useAsync`, why don't we just treat the
`asyncCallback` as a dependency? Any time `asyncCallback` changes, we know that
we should call it again. The problem is that because our `asyncCallback` depends
on the `pokemonName` which comes from props, it has to be defined within the
body of the component, which means that it will be defined on every render which
means it will be new every render. This is where `React.useCallback` comes in!

Here's a quick intro to the `React.useCallback` API:

```javascript
function ConsoleGreeting(props) {
  const greet = React.useCallback(
    greeting => console.log(`${greeting} ${props.name}`),
    [props.name],
  )

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const helloGreeting = 'Hello'
    greet(helloGreeting)
  }, [greet])
  return <div>check the console</div>
}
```

The first argument to `useCallback` is the callback you want called, the second
argument is an array of dependencies which is similar to `useEffect`. When one
of the dependencies changes between renders, the callback you passed in the
first argument will be the one returned from `useCallback`. If they do not
change, then you'll get the callback which was returned the previous time (so
the callback remains the same between renders).

So we only want our `asyncCallback` to change when the `pokemonName` changes.
See if you can make things work like this:

```javascript
// 🐨 you'll need to define asyncCallback as a value returned from React.useCallback
const state = useAsync(asyncCallback)
```

## 🦉 Other notes

### lazy initialization

This one's not an extra credit, but _sometimes_ lazy initialization can be
useful, so here's how we'd do that with our original hook usage:

```javascript
function init(initialStateFromProps) {
  return {
    pokemon: null,
    loading: false,
    error: null,
  }
}

// ...

const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, props.initialState, init)
```

So, if you pass a third function argument to `useReducer`, it passes the second
argument to that function and uses the return value for the initial state.

This could be useful if our `init` function read into localStorage or something
else that we wouldn't want happening every re-render.
